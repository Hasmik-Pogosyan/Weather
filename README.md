# Weather
This is a simple, responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for any city worldwide to get current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a corresponding weather icon (like rain, clouds, clear, etc.).
